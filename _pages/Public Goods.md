<span style="color:black"> I have recently started a project that aims to retrieve statistics from various administrative sources in Haiti and make them available to the public. In the context of developing countries, datasets are often held in non-accessible formats for researchers. My efforts involve obtaining datasets, cleaning them, and transforming them into usable formats. The first batch of data will be released on september 15th, 2023. For any inquiries or assistance, feel free to contact me at k.blaise@uea.ac.uk.</span>

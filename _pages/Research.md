 <sub>[**1- Volatility on the Crypto-currency Market: A Copula-GARCH Approach (with Peter G. Moffatt and Andrea Calef)**](https://kensleyblaise.github.io/assets/files/crypto_copula.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:style="color: blue;"}</sub>

 <sub> **Abstract:** </sub>
 <sub> *This research investigates whether crypto-currency returns correlate with expected uncertainty related to the global economy or other risky markets. In a first attempt, we use the copula framework to estimate the dependence magnitude between returns on the crypto-currency market, the interest rate spread, the breakeven inflation and the volatility index from the S&P500 options (VIX). Our results show that uncertainty information about future policy and the state of the economy contained in the interest rate spread bears no importance in crypto-currency price fluctuations. However, we find a pattern, although relatively small, for high estimated crypto-currency returns volatility to overlap with low VIX values. On another level, we find evidence that dynamic time series models can improve our understanding of price fluctuations on the crypto-currency market. We estimate a 5.6 percentage points increase of today's log-returns on the crypto-currency market for each one percentage point increase of yesterday's breakeven inflation. The effect is instantaneous and about 12 percentage points in recent time periods (2020-2022).* </sub>

 <sub>[**2- A Continuous-time Theory of Currency Substitution**](https://kensleyblaise.github.io/assets/files/kensley_blaise_currency_substitution.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:style="color: blue;"}</sub>

 <sub> **Abstract:** </sub>
 <sub> *We analyze the coexistence of cash (fiat money) and privately-issued currencies (crypto-currencies) in a dynamic model where all factors of production are paid in fiat money. This introduces a cash-in-advance constraint that affects both consumption and investment, leading to non-neutrality of money. Crypto-currencies add distortions through labor reallocation and transaction fees. Using flexible utility specifications, we explore the impact of substitutability between money and crypto-purchased goods. Our main result is that an increase in the money supply raises inflation and shifts labor allocation, affecting growth dynamics. While broader economic variables remain stable, real wages are highly sensitive to changes in consumer preferences and crypto-fees, underscoring the impact of private digital currencies on the economy's long-term trajectory.* </sub>

  <sub>**3- Information Disclosures and Price Movements: A High-Frequency Identification Approach (with A. Calef and G. vecchio)**</sub>

 <sub> **Abstract:** </sub>
 <sub> *We constructed a cross-sectional dataset comprising filings from 10,000 corporations in the United States, sourced from the Securities Exchange Commission historical archives, to examine how firms' information disclosures affect equity prices. Traditionally, the efficient market hypothesis posits that essential information is inherently reflected in asset prices. Our dataset includes each firm's risk assessment and descriptions of investments, including future strategic decisions. We align this textual data with high-frequency equity prices to assess market absorption of information. Specifically, we investigate price movements in a 30-minute window surrounding report releases. Our preliminary findings indicate that the market effectively predicts financial information related to new projects and strategic investments. However, managerial decisions often surprise the market, leading to a 2.14\% price decline when corporations announce layoffs or release deceptive information. Additionally, we observe that information becomes more influential in predicting price movements for companies with lower financial valuation. We interpret this finding as suggesting that higher-valued companies may exhibit greater managerial resilience to changes, thereby reducing market perceptions of risk associated with critical information.* </sub>

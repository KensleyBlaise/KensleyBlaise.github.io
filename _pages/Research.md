 <sub>[**1- Volatility on the Crypto-currency Market: A Copula-GARCH Approach.**](https://kensleyblaise.github.io/assets/files/crypto_copula.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:style="color: blue;"}</sub>

 <sub> **Abstract:** </sub>

 <sub> *This study analyzes the relationship between crypto-currencies, proxied by a Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) index, and key macroeconomic variables from April 2013 to May 2024. We focus on US term spread, Volatility Index (VIX), and 5-year breakeven inflation as predictors. Our findings reveal no significant dependence between returns and the term spread, suggesting investors do not consider policy paths or economic cycles when trading crypto-currencies. In contrast, extreme low VIX values are linked to high Crypto-currency Market (CM) volatility, with upper tail dependence estimated at 3.7\% and 7.6\% using Gumbel-Hougaard and Joe copulas, respectively. Our copula modeling exercise also shows a weak correlation of crypto-currency returns with breakeven inflation. Robustness checks, including a sub-sample analysis and variable transformation, confirm these results. We find that while crypto-currencies exhibit weak links to certain financial fundamentals, they respond differently to economic indicators compared to traditional assets, showing increased returns during restrictive monetary policies. The study highlights a need for further research integrating extreme events with dynamic time series analysis to better understand these relationships.* </sub> 


 <sub>[**2- A Continuous-time Theory of Currency Substitution.**](https://kensleyblaise.github.io/assets/files/kensley_blaise_currency_substitution.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:style="color: blue;"}</sub>

 <sub> **Abstract:** </sub>
 <sub> *We analyze the coexistence of cash (fiat money) and privately-issued currencies (crypto-currencies) in a dynamic model where all factors of production are paid in fiat money. This introduces a cash-in-advance constraint that affects both consumption and investment, leading to non-neutrality of money. Crypto-currencies add distortions through labor reallocation and transaction fees. Using flexible utility specifications, we explore the impact of substitutability between money and crypto-purchased goods. Our main result is that an increase in the money supply raises inflation and shifts labor allocation, affecting growth dynamics. While broader economic variables remain stable, real wages are highly sensitive to changes in consumer preferences and crypto-fees, underscoring the impact of private digital currencies on the economy's long-term trajectory.* </sub>

  <sub>[**3- Currency Competition and Monetary Non-neutrality (with Simone Valente).**](https://kensleyblaise.github.io/assets/files/blaise_valente_static_substitution.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:style="color: blue;"}</sub>

 <sub> **Abstract:** </sub>
 <sub> We build a theoretical model where both fiat money and crypto-currencies are used as media of exchange for differentiated goods. Crypto-currencies offer pecuniary benefits, such as avoiding consumption taxes, and non-pecuniary benefits like transaction privacy, while non-users face utility losses that grow with available goods. We identify an endogenous threshold good where consumers are indifferent between government-backed money and privately-issued currency, leading to three equilibrium scenarios: all goods purchased with fiat, all with crypto, or a mix of both. Our model predicts that, while fiat money is neutral, crypto-currencies are non-neutral due to mining costs, which affect labor allocation. * </sub>

   <sub>**4- A Direct Test of the Fundamental Assumption of Option Pricing Models (with Peter G MOFFATT and Anthony REZITIS).** [<span style="color: blue;"> Draft available upon request</span>].</sub>

 <sub> **Abstract:** </sub>
 <sub> *The most fundamental assumption underlying option pricing models is that the market price of an option is equal to the discounted expected value of the final payoff.  In this paper, we test this assumption directly with data on market prices of options combined with data on realised final payoffs.  The data set contains around 25 million European options written on the S&P500 index, between January 2022 and December 2023, with expiry dates ranging from January 2022 to July 2025.  Only “near-the-money” options are included in the sample.  The framework for testing the hypothesis of interest is a heteroscedastic regression model with discounted actual payoff at expiry as the dependent variable, and market price of the option as the independent variable.  The joint hypothesis under test is essentially that the intercept is zero and the slope is one.  This hypothesis is tested both parametrically and non-parametrically.  As well as being tested for the entire sample, it is tested separately for call options and put options.  It is also tested separately for bull-market phases and bear-market phases. The fundamental assumption is always strongly rejected, usually with the intercept being different from zero but the slope not being different from one.  We conclude that a useful way of judging the performance of an option pricing model is to compare computed option valuations to discounted final payoffs, rather than to market prices.* </sub>

  <sub>**5- Information Disclosures and Price Movements: A High-Frequency Identification Approach (with A. Calef and G. vecchio).**[<span style="color: blue;"> Draft available upon request</span>].</sub>

 <sub> **Abstract:** </sub>
 <sub> *We constructed a cross-sectional dataset comprising filings from 10,000 corporations in the United States, sourced from the Securities Exchange Commission historical archives, to examine how firms' information disclosures affect equity prices. Traditionally, the efficient market hypothesis posits that essential information is inherently reflected in asset prices. Our dataset includes each firm's risk assessment and descriptions of investments, including future strategic decisions. We align this textual data with high-frequency equity prices to assess market absorption of information. Specifically, we investigate price movements in a 30-minute window surrounding report releases. Our preliminary findings indicate that the market effectively predicts financial information related to new projects and strategic investments. However, managerial decisions often surprise the market, leading to a 2.14\% price decline when corporations announce layoffs or release deceptive information. Additionally, we observe that information becomes more influential in predicting price movements for companies with lower financial valuation. We interpret this finding as suggesting that higher-valued companies may exhibit greater managerial resilience to changes, thereby reducing market perceptions of risk associated with critical information.* </sub>

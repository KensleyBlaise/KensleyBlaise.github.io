  # Volatility on the Crypto-currency Market: A Copula-GARCH Approach (with Peter G. Moffatt and Andrea Calef) \

 <sub> This module is designed for Msc students seeking a high-level understanding of econometric analysis. It is divided into two parts. The first part reviews the fundamental elements of the regression analysis, meaning the properties of the OLS estimator, issues in linear models, model evaluation, etc. The second part is devoted to teaching logit, probit and multinomial models. We then finish the module by introducing some elements of classication methods and other state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning. </sub>

 <sub> I am a third year Ph.D. student in Economics at the [University of East Anglia (UEA)](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-economics) in the UK. I obtained my master's degree in Economics with distinction from the same university, and my bachelor's degree from the State University of Haiti. I was ranked first out of around 200 students in my undergraduate cohort.  <sub> 
  
 <sub> I was awarded merit-based scholarships for my bachelor's degree (Government of Haiti), my master's degree (Chevening scholarhsip) and my doctoral studies (University of East Anglia). </sub>
 
 <sub> Prior to starting my doctoral studies, I worked at the research department of the Central Bank of Haiti. </sub>
 
 <sub> ***My research focuses on: Macroeconomics, Finance and Digital Currencies.*** </sub>

<sub> ***NEWS:***  <span style="color:blue"> *I have recently started a project of retrieving statictics from various administrative sources in Haiti and making them available to the public. See the Public Goods item for more or contact me at k.blaise@uea.ac.uk*.</span>

 <sub> I hold a Ph.D. in Economics (2025) from the [University of East Anglia (UEA)](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-economics) in the UK. I earned my master's degree in Economics with distinction from the same university, and my bachelor's degree from the National Higher School of Technology, where I ranked first among 400 students in my undergraduate cohort.  <sub> 
 
 <sub> I currently work at the Bank of England (BoE). Before embarking on my doctoral studies, I gained valuable experience working on forecasting and data analytics projects at the Central Bank of Haiti. I briefly served as a consultant to the Office of the Prime Minister on macroeconomic policies. </sub>
 
 <sub> ***My academic interests are in business analytics, computational Finance, and applied machine learning. I also use computational tools to construct and analyze novel datasets on corporate filings.*** </sub>

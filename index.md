 <sub> I am a third year Ph.D. student in Economics at the [University of East Anglia (UEA)](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-economics) in the UK. I obtained my master's degree in Economics with distinction from the same university, and my bachelor's degree from the State University of Haiti. I was ranked first out of around 200 students in my undergraduate cohort.  <sub> 
  
 <sub> I was awarded merit-based scholarships for my bachelor's degree (Government of Haiti), my master's degree (Chevening scholarhsip) and my doctoral studies (University of East Anglia). </sub>
 

 
 <sub> Prior to starting my doctoral studies, I worked at the research department of the Central Bank of Haiti. </sub>
 

**My research focuses on:**
  - Macroeconomics 
  - Finance
  - Digital Currencies 

<sub> ***NEWS:*** I have recently started a project of cleaning and making available statistics on Haiti. Please get in touch if your research interests cross over my areas of expertise or if you are willing to get data to to conduct research on Haiti.<sub>

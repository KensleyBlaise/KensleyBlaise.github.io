 <sub> I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Economics at the [University of East Anglia (UEA)](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-economics) in the UK. I earned my master's degree in Economics with distinction from the same university, and my bachelor's degree from the State University of Haiti, where I ranked first among 200 students in my undergraduate cohort.  <sub> 
  
 <sub> Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to receive full merit-based scholarships for my bachelor's degree (Government of Haiti), my master's degree (Chevening scholarhsip), and my doctoral studies (University of East Anglia). </sub>
 
 <sub> Before embarking on my doctoral studies, I gained valuable experience working at the research department of the Central Bank of Haiti. </sub>
 
 <sub> ***My research focuses on: Macroeconomics, Finance and Digital Currencies.*** </sub>

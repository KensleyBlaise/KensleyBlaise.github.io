I am a third year Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in the UK. I obtained my master's degree in Economics (with distinction) from the same university, and my bachelor's degree at the State University of Haiti (ranked 1st in my cohort of around 200 students). I was awarded the British Government merit-based and fully-funded Chevening scholarhsip for my master's degree.
